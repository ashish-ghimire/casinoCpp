Casino is a card game played by 2 players.

The Objective: 

The objective of this game is to score the most points by capturing cards.

The Players: 

Two players play this game - one player will be the human user of your program, and the other player will be your program/computer. The two players will play a "tournament", consisting of one or more rounds.Each r ound will consist of the two players playing till all the cards have been captured. The tournament ends when one of the players scores 21 or more points.

The Setup: 

A standard 52-card deck is used.

Initially, the first four cards of the deck are dealt to the human player and the next four cards are dealt to the computer. Thereafter, the next four cards in the deck are placed face up on the table.

Each time all the players have played all their cards, four more cards are dealt first to the human player and then to the computer from the remaining deck and the round continues. When the deck is exhausted and all the cards have been played, the round ends.

In this game, Kings are valued at 13, Queens at 12, and Jacks at 11. Aces can be valued at 14 or 1, as convenient. Other cards are valued at their face value.

A Round
The two players take alternate turns till the round ends.

A Turn
During her turn, a player plays exactly one card from her hand, in one of three ways:
    Build: A build is a group of cards that must be played together.
     
        Building a build: The player can combine the played card with a loose card or cards on the table to form a build. (A  loose card is a card that is not part of any build.) In order to do so:
        The player must also have the card in her hand whose value is the sum of the cards in the build, e.g., 2 and 3 loose cards are on the table, and the player plays a 5 to create a build of the three cards 2, 3 and 5 because the player also has a 10 card in her hand that she can play in the future to capture the entire build (2 + 3 + 5 = 10). In this scenario, the 2 and 3 cards were loose cards, i.e., they were not part of any other build.
        The player is required to hold the 10 card in her hand until the build is captured or another player takes over the build.
        As the player who most recently added a card to the build, the player becomes its owner. 
        
        Multiple build:	A player can create multiple builds, all with the same capture value, e.g., a build of 6 and 3, another of 5 and 4, and yet another of 8 and Ace.
        Increasing a build: A player can add a card to a single build owned by an opponent to increase the value of the build if the player also has the card in her hand with the value equal to the increased sum of the build, e.g., the opponent has a build of 6+3; the player adds 2 to the build since the player also has Jack in her hand (6 + 3 + 2 = 11). The player who added the card now becomes the owner of the build. But adding a card to a build cannot be done if the build is part of multiple builds. It cannot be done by a player to his own build. 
        
        Capture: The player may play a card to capture one or more cards on the table:
        
        Individual card: If the played card matches an individual card on the table, that card must be captured, e.g., if the player plays a 6, the player will capture any and all 6 cards on the table.
        
        Set of cards: If the played card matches the sum of a set of cards on the table, the player may choose to capture the set of cards or not, e.g., if the player plays an 8, and a 5 and 3 are on the table, the player may choose to capture both the 5 and 3 from the table with her 8 card. If the player plays an Ace (value of 14), the player can capture a King (value of 13) and another Ace (value of 1) on the table.
        
        Combination of individual and set of cards: The player can capture one or more individual cards as well as one or more sets of cards all with the same played card, e.g., if the player plays a 9 and the cards on the table are 9, 5, 4, 6 and 3, the player can capture all the cards with the same 9 card since 5 + 4 = 9 and 6 + 3 = 9. Whereas the player must capture the 9 card, capturing the 5 and 4 set or the 6 and 3 set is left to the player's discretion.
        
        The above rules apply only as long as the captured cards are not part of a build.
        
        The player has the option to (but is not required to) capture one or more complete builds (single or multiple) whose value is equal to that of the played card. 
    The played card and the captured card(s) are added to the player's pile.
        
        Trail: The player plays a card that does not match any individual loose card, and therefore, cannot capture any individual loose card. The played card is left on the table, to be captured or incorporated into a build later. Note that if the played card matches a set of cards or a build, since capturing them is not mandatory, the player can choose to trail rather than capture with the card.
        
    Trailing option is not available to the owner of a build - since that player can play the card matching the build to capture it or work on a multiple build. 


Round Ending
The round ends when the players have played all the cards and the deck is empty. Any cards that remain on the table are taken by the last player that made a capture.
The piles of both the players are printed at the end of the round.

Score
When a round ends, the points earned by each player are calculated based on the cards in each player's pile:

    The player with the most cards in the pile gets 3 points. In the event of a tie, neither player gets points.
    The player with the most spades gets 1 point. In the event of a tie, neither player gets points.
    The player with 10 of Diamonds gets 2 points.
    The player with 2 of Spades gets 1 point.
    Each player gets one point per Ace. 

The scores earned by the two players must be declared at the end of each round.
The tournament scores of both the players must be updated and printed at the end of each round.

Winning the tournament
If either player's score reaches or crosses 21 points by the end of a round, the tournament ends. Otherwise, a new round is started. When the tournament ends, the player with the greater score wins the tournament. If both players go over 21 points in the same round and end up with the same tournament score, the tournament results in a tie.

First Player
On the first round of the tournament, a coin is flipped and the human player is asked to call the toss to determine the first player. On subsequent rounds, the player who captured last on the previous round plays first.
